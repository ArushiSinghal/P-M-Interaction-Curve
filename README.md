# P-M-Interaction Curve
Column interaction diagram is a visual representation of the combined loads (bending and Axial) that will cause the column to fail.
P-M interaction curve is generated using MATLAB code, for fy =415 MPa; dâ€™/D = 0.10 and p/f ck = 0.10 to 0.16 at an interval of 0.02.

Code:- Matlab_code.m
